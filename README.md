## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayan-sss/Weather_APP.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Weather_APP
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeather API key:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   You can obtain an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Usage

1. **Search**: Enter the name of a city in the input field and click the search button.
2. **View Weather Data**: The app will display the weather details such as:
   - Temperature (in Celsius)
   - Weather conditions (Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed
   - Weather icon representing the condition.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Based on the search result, the background image changes to reflect the weather condition (e.g., clear skies, rain, clouds).

## API Integration

This app uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data. The integration occurs in the following steps:

1. The user enters a city name.
2. A GET request is sent to OpenWeather API using the entered city name.
3. The app receives the weather data and processes it to display:
   - Temperature
   - Weather description
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed
   - An icon representing the weather condition

Make sure you have your API key set up in the `.env` file as explained in the [Installation](#installation) section.
